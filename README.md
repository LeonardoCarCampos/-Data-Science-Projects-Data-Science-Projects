# 🧠 Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science project portfolio! This repository gathers a collection of practical projects where I apply statistical analysis, machine learning, and data engineering concepts to solve real-world problems.

Each project demonstrates a specific area of expertise, from supervised and unsupervised learning to time series forecasting and business intelligence.
